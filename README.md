![BO2 Banner](https://public-files.gumroad.com/ta6jrmijyv7e9emp5x2pf7zyicyz)

**T6TC** is an **automated texture changer** for *Call of Duty: Black Ops II*.  
This project was originally made years ago by my good friend **Kate, also known as Ardiium** — **she has asked me to open-source it for her, and possibly even update it**. It’s simple to use, and still one of the best ways to customize your BO2 visuals.

## 📝 Notes from Kate

> *"I built this tool when I was about 14 years old. Since then I’ve learned a lot, but please don’t bash me for how messy the code may be.  
> I wanted to release this so others — whether they’re knowledgeable in programming or not — could venture into the same space and possibly even continue the tool.  
> I don’t know where COD editing is at right now, but… yolo."*  
> — **Kate**, original creator
